<p>The printed book did not number the pages in sequence; instead it
numbered the recto (odd, right) pages of the first few leaves in each
signature. Folio numbers in smaller print were added by the transcriber;
all verso (even, left) pages are shown as&nbsp;||. Two sets of pages
were apparently printed out of sequence. Details are given at the
<a href = "#endnote">end of the text</a>, along with notes on a few other
problems.</p>

<p>A few words such as “with” or “the” were printed as abbreviations:
initial “y” (for þ, thorn) or “w” with small “t” or “e” above it. These
are shown as ordinary superscripts: y<sup>e</sup>, w<sup>t</sup>.
Typographical errors are shown with <ins class = "correction" title =
"like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>. Numerals such as “.x.” were
printed without adjoining spaces; spacing has been silently added.</p>

<h5>Mixed Pages</h5>

<p>Two sets of three pages appear to have been printed out of order:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Page <b>aa.vi.</b> (11, beginning <i>Vnto her I answerde o lady
gloryous</i>) appears before pages <b>aa.v.</b> and
<b>aa.v.<i>verso</i></b> (9 and 10, beginning <i>Be to thy kynge euer
true subgete</i>).</p>

<p class = "inset">
Pages <b>ff.iii.</b> (69, beginning <i>Whan I had scomfyte this serpent
venymous</i>) and <b>ff.iiii.</b> (71, beginning <i>And there met me
dame clennes blyue</i>) are transposed, with <b>ff.iii.<i>verso</i></b>
(70, beginning <i>Than came dame fayth that lady gloryous</i>) between
them.</p>

<p>Each involves pages from the later part of a signature, so page
numbering is absent. It is not known whether the error is from the
original printing or from the facsimile reprint.</p>

<p>Printed folio numbers show an unusual pattern:</p>

<p class = "inset">
<b>aa</b>, <b>cc</b>, <b>ee</b>: 16 pages each<br>
<b>gg</b>: 12 pages<br>
<b>bb</b>, <b>dd</b>, <b>ff</b>, <b>hh</b>: 8 pages</p>

<h5>Duplicate Chapter Heads</h5>

<p>Chapter headings for .vi. and .vii. were printed near the bottom of
the page&mdash;as main text, not catchwords&mdash;and again at the top
of the following page. This pattern was not consistently followed for
all
chapters that began at the top of a page.</p>

<h5>Unusual Errors</h5>

<p><a name = "noteA" id = "noteA" href = "#tagA">A.</a>
<b>Discrecõn</b>, <b>temptacõn</b><br>
Both words occur in full-length lines of prose. When the typesetter saw
that he needed an abbreviation to make the line fit, he may have removed
the wrong letter from the word to be abbreviated.</p>

<p><img src = "images/discr.png" width = "567" height = "29"
alt = "text image"></p>

<p class = "inset">
and</p>

<p><img src = "images/tempt.png" width = "573" height = "30"
alt = "text image"></p>

<p><a name = "noteB" id = "noteB">B.</a>
In four places the printed text has an unusual letter. It has been
transcribed as “z” or “ȝ” (yogh) according to context, though it is the
same letterform every time:</p>

<p><img src = "images/lastletter1.png" width = "237" height = "30"
alt = "text image"> &nbsp; <a class = "tag" href = "#tagB1">text</a>
<!-- Azia --></p>

<p><img src = "images/lastletter2.png" width = "250" height = "33"
alt = "text image"> &nbsp; <a class = "tag" href = "#tagB2">text</a>
<!-- hiz --><p>
<p class = "inset">
There is no apparent reason for abbreviating “kynge” in this line.</p>

<p><img src = "images/lastletter3.png" width = "246" height = "30"
alt = "text image"> &nbsp; <a class = "tag" href = "#tagB3">text</a>
<!-- mi[gh]t --></p>

<p><img src = "images/lastletter4.png" width = "152" height = "26"
alt = "text image"> &nbsp; <a class = "tag" href = "#tagB4">text</a>
<!-- morylyzacyon -->
</p>

<p><a name = "noteC" id = "noteC" href = "#tagC">C.</a>
<b>bl[ey]nde</b><br>
A small “e”, required by the rhyme, is printed above “y”, required by
the sense.</p>

<p><a name = "noteD" id = "noteD" href = "#tagD">D.</a>
<b>so gretly slynkynge</b><br>
The printed text is very slightly defective. The reading “stynkynge”
fits the sense better, but the letterforms are closer to “sl-”.</p>

<p><a name = "noteE" id = "noteE" href = "#tagE">E.</a>
<b>doubtaũce</b><br>
Text reads “doubtauũce”, possibly through confusion with the preceding
line, where the “governaũce” abbreviation was required by line
length:</p>
<p><img src = "images/aunce.png" width = "439" height = "57"alt =
"text image"></p>
